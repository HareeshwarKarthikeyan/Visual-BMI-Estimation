Images in the VIP_attribute dataset are obtained in 2017 from the WWW corresponding to 513 female and 513 male subjects (mainly actors, singers and athletes). The images include the frontal pose of the subjects. Co-variates include illumination, expression, image quality and resolution. Further challenging in this dataset are beautification (e.g., photoshop) of the images, as well as the presence of makeup, plastic surgery, beard and mustache. We obtained annotations related to te subjects' body weight and height from websites such as www.celebheights.com, www.howtallis.org and celebsize.com.
